# Titanic Survival Prediction: Gradient Boosting & Advanced Data Analysis

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning analysis of the Titanic dataset using Gradient Boosting techniques, advanced data imputation methods, and systematic model optimization. The notebook demonstrates end-to-end data science workflows, from exploratory data analysis to model deployment considerations.

## Problem Statement

The Titanic disaster remains one of history's most infamous shipwrecks. This project aims to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on:
- Understanding which factors most influenced survival rates
- Implementing robust data preprocessing and imputation strategies
- Optimizing Gradient Boosting models for maximum predictive accuracy
- Investigating the relationship between model complexity (n_estimators) and performance

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains passenger information including:
- **Demographics**: Age, Sex, Class
- **Family Relations**: Number of siblings/spouses, parents/children aboard
- **Economic Status**: Ticket fare, passenger class
- **Logistics**: Port of embarkation, cabin information
- **Target Variable**: Survival (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

## Methodology

The project is structured into three comprehensive sections:

### Section A: Data Imputation Techniques
- Implementation of multiple imputation strategies for missing values
- Comparison of mean, median, mode, and advanced imputation methods
- Impact assessment of different imputation techniques on model performance
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing best practices

### Section B: Gradient Boosting Implementation
- Complete implementation of Gradient Boosting classifier on the Titanic dataset
- Feature importance analysis and interpretation
- Model validation using cross-validation techniques
- Performance metrics evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

### Section C: N_Estimators Optimization Study
- Systematic experimentation with varying numbers of decision trees
- Analysis of the bias-variance tradeoff in ensemble methods
- Performance vs. computational complexity analysis
- Identification of optimal model parameters

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Processing**: Missing value handling, outlier detection, data cleaning
- **Feature Engineering**: Variable transformation, categorical encoding, feature selection
- **Model Implementation**: Gradient Boosting, ensemble methods, hyperparameter tuning
- **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation, performance metrics, statistical significance testing

## Results

Key findings from the analysis:
- Optimal imputation strategies significantly improve model performance
- Gradient Boosting achieves superior performance compared to baseline models
- The relationship between n_estimators and model performance follows predictable patterns
- Feature importance analysis reveals the most critical survival factors
